# dockedOCent
DOCKerizED Open Code agENT workflow framework. The main goal is to make agents in opencode effective to work. One of main feature is parallel development, it's like lead group of juniors. But I also goint to do some another interesting things:
## todos:
- parallelization: by passing current code into docker without binding there can be more then one agents works on one project. (paralel features making)
- initiators: you can choose what scripts are run before opencode starts.
- verifies: you can choose what scripts are run when opencode ends.
- git restrictions: You can choose what agent can do with git
- databases: you know for longterm planning, history, etc.
- aliases for effective using
